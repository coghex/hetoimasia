# hetoimasia-lua-engine

The Lua-first engine's **pure configuration boundary** (LFE-3 of
[the design](../../docs/designs/lua_first_engine_design.md)): a strict parser for
the format-1 launch manifest `hetoimasia.json`, from supplied bytes to a
resolved role, entry and tick configuration, and the **fixed M1 profile** of
limits with validated, smaller test profiles.

It opens no folder, reads no file, starts no Lua, worker, window or GPU, prints
nothing, exits nowhere and performs no IO. Every function is pure and returns
a plain value or a bounded refusal.

The library depends on `hetoimasia-foundation` (its `Duration`, checked
nanoseconds from 1 to 2^64 − 1) and on `array`, `base`, `bytestring`,
`containers` and `text`. It depends on no GLFW, Vulkan, console, sample or
game package, and it imports no module that performs IO. Later slices add
the content layer (LFE-4 to LFE-6), Lua adapters and role composition to this
package; they are not here.

| Module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `Hetoimasia.LuaEngine.Manifest` | `parseManifest`, `parseManifestWith`; `Manifest`, `RoleSelection`, `declaredEntries`; every refusal type |
| `Hetoimasia.LuaEngine.Profile` | `fixedM1Profile`, `validateProfile`; the limit types and their accessors; the derived values |

Every other module is hidden. A client imports these two.

## The manifest

`parseManifest bytes` takes the bytes of exactly one root manifest and returns
a `Manifest` or the first `ManifestError`. The caller reads the file and names
the root; this package never learns a path.

```haskell
parseManifest ∷ ByteString → Either ManifestError Manifest
parseManifestWith ∷ Profile → ByteString → Either ManifestError Manifest
```

### What a `Manifest` holds, and what it does not claim

- `manifestBytes` are the exact bytes that were parsed (the caller's buffer, not
  a reserialization), so later anchored inventory and fingerprint work checks
  what was actually parsed.
- `manifestId` is the validated stable content identifier, exactly as written.
- `manifestRoles` is `GameplayOnly`, `PresentationOnly` or `BothRoles`. A
  gameplay role carries its tick `Duration` and a presentation role carries no
  tick, so a tick without gameplay, or gameplay without a tick, cannot be
  represented. Each role records its selected entry text and whether it came from
  the role's own `entry` (`ExplicitEntry`) or from the common one
  (`CommonEntry`). A text both roles share is one authored input that each VM
  will still load independently.
- `manifestCommonEntry` and `declaredEntries` keep **every declared entry
  text**, including a common `entry` that every role overrides. The later
  inventory check must cover all of them, not only the selected ones.
- Array order in `vms` is not startup or dependency order and is not recorded.
  No bootstrap VM is invented and no role is created to satisfy an entry.

The result claims nothing about the filesystem. Entry texts are kept exactly as
decoded: the root-relative literal-path grammar, NFC and case identity (LFE-5),
inventory regular-file presence (LFE-6) and hash verification are the content
layer's, and run before any Lua. The parser has no path normalization of its own
that could disagree with that layer.

### Syntax

A non-executable UTF-8 JSON object. RFC 8259 is the grammar; this profile is
stricter in these ways, all refused as `ManifestSyntax`:

- at most **65,536 bytes**, whitespace included (`ManifestTooLarge`, decided
  first and without reading the bytes);
- well-formed UTF-8 (`InvalidUtf8`) and no byte order mark (`ByteOrderMark`);
- no comments, trailing commas, `NaN`, `Infinity`, single quotes, unescaped
  control characters U+0000–U+001F, invalid escapes, or unpaired surrogate
  `\u` escapes; whitespace is only space, tab, line feed and carriage return;
- nesting of at most **eight containers**, the outer object counting
  (`NestingTooDeep`), enforced as containers open;
- no duplicate object key **after JSON escape decoding**, at every object
  (`DuplicateKey`, with the path). Duplicates are looked for before any object is
  collapsed into a map, so there is no last-key-wins behavior;
- nothing but whitespace after the object (`TrailingData`), and the root is an
  object (`RootNotObject`).

No includes, interpolation or execution exist.

**Bounds.** The byte and depth limits come from the profile and are enforced
during parsing, not after a tree exists. A number is kept as slices of the input
and examined by digit counts: no value, `Integer`, power of ten or allocation
grows with an exponent's size, so `1e999999999` costs no more than its nine
digits. Strings and arrays are bounded by the input.

### Schema

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `format` | Required JSON number whose **exact decimal value is 1**: `1`, `1.0`, `1e0`, `10E-1` and `0.1e1` are accepted; `1.00000000000000000001`, `0.99999999999999999999`, `-1` and `1e999999999` are refused (`UnsupportedFormat`). Never converted to binary floating point. A string is refused. |
| `id` | Required, 1–64 ASCII characters matching `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*` (`InvalidId`). Exact case, never derived from a folder. |
| `entry` | Optional common entry text; the fallback for a selected role without its own. |
| `tick_seconds` | Decimal text, required exactly when gameplay is selected (`TickRequired`) and forbidden for presentation only (`TickForbidden`). No default. |
| `vms` | Optional array of one or two role declarations (`EmptyVms`, `TooManyVms`). Absent selects both roles. |

A role declaration is an object with required `role` and `clock` strings and
optional `entry`, and no other field. Only `gameplay`/`logical` and
`presentation`/`elapsed` pair (`UnknownRole`, `UnknownClock`, `ClockMismatch`),
and a role appears once (`DuplicateRole`). An explicit per-role `entry` overrides
the common one; a role with neither is `MissingEntry`.

No `mods`, dependency, compatibility, asset-list, window, cadence or metadata
field is accepted (`UnknownField`). `null` is `NullValue` and a wrong type is
`WrongType`; nothing is ignored or coerced.

### `tick_seconds`

ASCII digits, optionally followed by a decimal point and one to nine digits, with
at least one digit before the point. No sign, exponent, whitespace, fraction
expression, JSON number substitution or default. Leading zeros and trailing
fraction zeros are harmless. The value converts **exactly** to whole nanoseconds
and must be at least 1 and at most 2^64 − 1 (the profile's maximum):
`"0.000000001"` and `"18446744073.709551615"` are the endpoints, and `"0"`,
`"18446744073.709551616"` and a tenth fraction digit are refused with a
`TickProblem`. A whole part too large to matter is refused before it is
converted. There is no rounding.

The `lua` command's own `parseSeconds` accepts the same text for its options. It
is console code and the engine never imports the console, so this package has
its own implementation of the same contract; the console is unchanged.

### Which refusal comes first

The order is fixed, and for a syntactically valid document it never depends on
member order:

1. the byte limit;
2. syntax, on the whole document: UTF-8, byte order mark, grammar and nesting
   (at the first offending byte), duplicate keys (the first object in document
   order that has one, then its first repeated key), trailing data;
3. the schema: unknown fields (the least key by code point, never the first
   written), then `format`, `id`, `entry`, `vms` (elements by index) and
   `tick_seconds`.

A refusal cites a location, never unbounded text: every offending string is an
`Excerpt` cut to 64 code points, and a `FieldPath` is at most eight segments.
Reordering the elements of a valid `vms` array resolves to the same
configuration; a refusal may cite an element's index.

## The fixed M1 profile

`fixedM1Profile` holds the production values, **defined once** and selected by
the future assembly. Nothing reads them from Lua, a manifest, the environment or
the command line, and there is no tuning API. Each limit is one constructor of a
closed type whose unit is the type: `ByteLimit` (`Bytes`), `CountLimit` (`Count`)
and `DurationLimit` (`Duration`). Read one with `bytesLimit`, `countLimit` or
`durationLimit`. KiB, MiB and GiB are powers of 1024.

| Family | Fixed M1 values |
| --- | --- |
| Manifest and content | 64 KiB manifest; depth 8 containers; 10,000 inventory entries including root; 32 path segments; 1,024 UTF-8 path bytes and 255 per segment, on the native/supplied and NFC forms |
| Hashing | 64 MiB per file; 1 GiB per root, summed by path; 64 KiB streaming buffer |
| Modules | 1 MiB source; 256 identities per VM including pending and failed; chain depth 32 including the root; 16 MiB uncompiled source bank per VM with 1 MiB reserved for the active chain's progress |
| Instances and requests | 2 instances per VM; the normal launcher creates one root per role; 16 accepted, unretired requests per instance and 64 per VM |
| Data and copied values | 8 MiB data or result; 64 MiB retained data bytes per VM; a copied crossing of 16 MiB, depth 8 and 65,536 elements |
| Scenes | 4,096 sprites; 2 MiB encoded input; depth 4; one latest scene and one bounded publication draft per window; no publication FIFO |
| Diagnostics | message 2 KiB; traceback 8 KiB; complete role-failure record 16 KiB; opaque instance ID 128 UTF-8 bytes; engine report 64 KiB with at most 16 secondary summaries of 2 KiB each; print and warn 4 KiB per call |
| PNG | 32 MiB encoded; 4,096 chunks; axes 1–2,048; 4,194,304 pixels; 40 MiB of inflated scanlines; 128 MiB accounted payload and workspace per texture pipeline |
| Textures | 16 pending, live and retiring leases and 128 MiB nominal bytes per UI instance; 256 MiB per session |
| Windows and sprites | 1 pending, live and retiring window slot per UI instance; title 512 UTF-8 bytes; requested width and height 1–4,096; x and y in [−1,000,000, 1,000,000]; width and height in (0, 1,000,000] |
| Native budget selection | 2 target records; 2 frame slots per window and 4 aggregate; 4 frameless batches; 2 generations per target; 16 tracked images per generation; 2 GiB accounted native bytes; 4,096 objects; reclaim pass of 64 records; 32 progress actions per turn; 100 ms maximum idle backoff |
| Workers | 2 I/O workers, 1 decode worker, 2 texture pipeline lanes |
| Numeric ranges | Lua logical tick, cadence, offset and wait counts and generated public counters through 2^63 − 1 (init tick 0, positive counts from 1); manifest duration through the full positive Word64 nanosecond range |

These are **configuration values**, not proof of live accounting, codec
allocation safety, GPU availability or a total Lua or process memory cap. The
slices that own admission and retirement enforce them, along with Float32
geometry, elapsed conversion and scheduling. They bound engine service payloads,
not Lua or process memory. The native budget values stay CPU data here; mapping
them into the backend's validated model belongs to the graphics composition.

### Derived, not stored

- `pngOutputBytes` is `rgba8BytesPerPixel` (4) times the pixel limit: 16 MiB.
  The same value is reserved at texture admission.
- `sceneElementBound` is 6 fixed elements plus 6 per sprite under the
  copied-value element counting (a table is one element, a key none): 24,582 at
  4,096 sprites, within 65,536.
- The **six adopted scene revisions per target** are not a limit here. The
  profile records the two frame slots per window; the graphics composition
  derives six from them (`2 * (slots + 1)`, owned by the Vulkan package, which
  this package never imports) and defers adoption when full.

### Smaller injected profiles

A test builds one by changing a copy of `profileSpec fixedM1Profile` and
validating it. `validateProfile` checks, in order, that the derived products fit
64 bits (`DerivedOverflow`), that every limit is positive and **no larger than
its fixed value** (`LimitNotPositive`, `LimitAboveFixed`), and that the
relations below hold (`RelationBroken`). A profile can only shrink; no value is
clamped. The 64-per-VM request limit is not "corrected" to fit 16 per instance
times 2 instances: independently bounded maxima need not be simultaneously
attainable.

| Relation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ManifestWithinHashFile`, `ModuleSourceWithinHashFile`, `HashFileWithinHashRoot` | the manifest and a module are files the hashing limit admits, and a file fits its root |
| `ActiveChainReserveHoldsModuleSource`, `ActiveChainReserveWithinSourceBank` | the active-chain reservation can hold one module's source and fits the bank |
| `ChainDepthWithinIdentities`, `RequestsPerInstanceWithinVm` | an active chain is among the cache identities; an instance's requests are among its VM's |
| `DataWithinRetainedBank`, `DataWithinCopiedValue` | a data result fits the VM's retained bytes and the crossing |
| `SceneInputWithinCopiedValue`, `SceneDepthWithinCopiedDepth`, `SceneElementsWithinCopiedElements` | scene limits fit the copied-value ceilings |
| `FailureRecordHoldsMessageAndTraceback`, `FailureRecordHoldsInstanceId`, `SecondarySummariesWithinReport` | a failure record holds its parts; the secondary summaries fit the engine report |
| `SegmentWithinPath`, `PathSegmentsWithinPathBytes` | a segment fits the path; each segment takes at least a byte |
| `PixelsWithinAxes` | the pixel limit does not exceed the axis limit squared |
| `OutputWithinTextureBytesPerUi`, `TextureBytesPerUiWithinSession`, `OutputWithinPipelineWorkspace`, `InflatedScanlinesWithinPipelineWorkspace` | one image's output fits a UI instance's bytes, which fit the session's, and fits the pipeline workspace with the inflated scanlines |
| `FrameSlotsAggregateHoldsWindow`, `FrameSlotsAggregateWithinTargets` | the aggregate holds one window's slots and no more than all targets could use |

## Deferred, by design

Not here, and not claimed: opening `hetoimasia.json`, anchored roots, the full
literal Unicode path identities, inventory and presence checks and SHA-256
verification (LFE-4 to LFE-6); the CLI `run` dispatch and exit mapping (LFE-22);
Lua evaluation, behavior and cadence capture, instance and service facades,
workers and session startup; live codec, texture and GPU budgets and their
enforcement; time sampling and scheduling; mods, metadata extensions, alternate
manifest formats, defaults or relaxed parsing.

## Tests

`lua-engine-tests` (validation group `test.lua-engine`, the CPU project, Hspec):

```sh
cabal test --project-file cabal.project.cpu hetoimasia-lua-engine:lua-engine-tests --test-show-details=direct
```

It performs no IO and starts no Lua, window or GPU. It covers the accepted
examples, every syntax and schema refusal with the limits at their boundary and
one past, the exact tick endpoints and forbidden forms, every fixed value against
an independently written expectation, valid smaller profiles and refused ones,
and this package's dependency and import boundary.
