# The Vulkan roots and their window integration

This is the delivered contract of VK-7 ([#219](https://github.com/coghex/hetoimasia/issues/219))
of [the Vulkan backend design](vulkan_backend_design.md): one graphics
session's Vulkan instance, its explicit debug messenger, its one shared device
and a target for every window surface handed to it, owned by the supervised
graphics owner and retired through its protected exit. It covers the design's
D-7, D-9, D-12, D-14, D-15, D-17, D-22, D-29, D-32 and D-33, and P-1, P-5, P-7,
P-8 and P-14 as far as this slice reaches.

Nothing is recorded, submitted or presented yet: there is no swapchain, no
command buffer and no queue submission, and the owner's progress step reports
no rendering work and no render demand — its only deadline is the brief
self-scheduled watch over an attachment whose announcement a full port
deferred, described below. Those are VK-10 through VK-13's. Acting on a target
policy's exhaustion is VK-14's, and completing device-loss teardown across
submitted work is VK-15's.

## Packages

| Package | Location | Holds | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hetoimasia-gpu-vulkan-native` | `packages/gpu-vulkan/native/` | The profile's decisions, the roots over an open native layer, and the production native layer | The binding, the diagnostics package, the GPU model, the foundation — never GLFW |
| `hetoimasia-gpu-vulkan-glfw` | `packages/gpu-vulkan/glfw/` | The session controller, the main-thread handover, the composition | The native package, `hetoimasia-glfw:runtime-glfw`, `hetoimasia-glfw:vulkan-interop`, the diagnostics package, the model |

The GLFW package depends on neither, and the native package does not depend on
the integration package. Both are listed only in `cabal.project.vulkan`, and
`cabal.project.common` holds their `-Werror` entries; `cabal.project` and
`cabal.project.cpu` resolve no Vulkan header, binding or loader. Only
[`tools/vulkan-proof/run-proof.sh`](../tools/vulkan-proof/README.md) builds
them. [`packages/gpu-vulkan/README.md`](../packages/gpu-vulkan/README.md) maps
all four GPU packages.

The integration package's public module is `Hetoimasia.GPU.Vulkan.GLFW`; its
controller lives in a private `controller` sublibrary. The native package
exposes `Hetoimasia.GPU.Vulkan.Native.Profile`,
`Hetoimasia.GPU.Vulkan.Native.Roots` and `Hetoimasia.GPU.Vulkan.Native.Roots.Vulkan`
beside VK-6's `Hetoimasia.GPU.Vulkan.Native.Diagnostics`.

```

- **The instance, its explicit messenger and the device belong to the roots**,
  for the session. No target owns the device or gates its lifetime —
  including the bootstrap target, whose surface the device was selected
  against — so closing the first-created window cannot release a device
  another target is using (D-7).
- **Each admitted target's surface belongs to the roots** from admission until
  its retirement destroys it. Each target record carries the model's
  `TargetId`, the application's required or optional designation (D-22), the
  surface's handle and the one action that destroys it.
- **The attachment and the window belong to the main thread.** A surface's
  obligation holds its attachment and the instance's lease from the instant
  the native call returns, so neither the window's release nor the instance's
  destruction can happen while the surface may exist (P-7).

## Composition

`withVulkanOwnerHost` composes, in P-5's order:

1. the loader capability, which the caller already holds, from
   `Hetoimasia.GLFW.Vulkan.withLoaderIntegration`;
2. the diagnostic lifetime (`withDiagnosticCapture`), whose capture both of the
   instance's messengers report into, and which the instance's destruction
   quiesces;
3. the loader-aware session, entered on the calling thread — which must be the
   process main thread — and which copies the instance extensions the
   platform's surfaces require (`requiredInstanceExtensions`) into the
   controller before the owner starts;
4. the protected window host and its graphics owner
   (`withGraphicsOwnerHostIn`), whose injected operations are the controller's;
5. the body, given a `VulkanHost`: the window host, the graphics owner and the
   controller.

Application supervision comes after, as the runner's own: register
`superviseGraphicsOwner` so a terminal owner failure reaches the application's
checkpoints. `withVulkanOwnerHostOver` is the same composition over an injected
native layer and surface bridge, which is what the headless examples drive.

It answers the body's result and the capture's verdict. The verdict's
quiescence evidence is what the instance's destruction returned; roots whose
instance was never created prove it trivially. However the host ends, an
instance it did not destroy keeps the capture's storage retained rather than
freed under a messenger that may still name it.

`VulkanHostConfig` names the host configuration, the capture configuration,
the instance layers to enable (each must be offered by the loader), the model's
budgets, the owner's initial scene, an adjustment to the owner's configuration,
and a `NativeObserver`: something that wraps every native call the controller
makes, for evidence. It must run each call once and answer what it answered; it
decides nothing, and the default observes nothing.

## Threads

| Work | Thread |
| --- | --- |
| Loader-aware session, extension copy, window creation, each surface's creation through GLFW | The process main thread |
| Instance and messenger creation and destruction, device selection and creation, the later-target check, every surface's destruction, device destruction | The graphics owner |

The controller makes no GLFW call. A surface is destroyed through the loader
capability's `vkDestroySurfaceKHR`, a Vulkan call, by the thread that holds its
obligation — the owner. The owner is one serialized Haskell thread, not a
promise of OS-thread affinity (P-1), so the evidence below requires its calls
to share one Haskell thread and each to run off the main OS thread.

## Startup

The owner's injected startup reads the extensions the session supplied (it is
refused with `InstanceExtensionsMissing` otherwise), plans the instance
against what the loader offers, creates the instance with the capture's
messenger chained into its create info, creates the explicit messenger, and
leases the instance to the surface bridge. `readReadiness` answers
`RootsReady` from then on, and an application hands windows over only after it.

The instance plan (`planInstance`) asks for Vulkan 1.3, the window system's
surface extensions, `VK_EXT_debug_utils`, `VK_KHR_get_surface_capabilities2`
and `VK_EXT_surface_maintenance1`, `VK_KHR_portability_enumeration` exactly
where the loader advertises it (with the enumerate-portability flag), and the
caller's layers. A loader below 1.3, a missing extension or a missing layer is
`InstanceRefusal`, naming the whole gap, before anything is created. A startup
that fails part-way leaves what it created recorded, and the owner's drain
retires and destroys it.

## Admitting targets

`handOverVulkanTarget` runs on the main thread. It attaches the window with a
protocol whose construction step:

1. registers the attachment with the owner's custody ledger — exactly
   `graphicsTargetProtocol`'s construction;
2. creates the surface through the surface bridge against the instance's lease;
3. deposits what it created, under the attachment's identity, for the owner.

The step is masked throughout. A cancellation aimed at the main thread
meanwhile arrives as the mask ends, still inside the step, where the host would
take it for a failed construction and roll back an attachment whose surface
exists; the step catches it, and the handover delivers it once the attachment
is published and announced, so the caller loses the answer rather than the
target. A synchronous failure is the construction's own. The handover then
announces the attachment to the owner through its bounded port:
`VulkanTargetHandedOver` when the port took it, `VulkanAnnouncementDeferred`
when the port was full, and `VulkanOwnerClosed` once the owner's admission has
ended. `VulkanRootsNotReady` attaches nothing.

A deferred attachment stays attached, with its surface deposited. The same
holds for an attachment whose answer a cancellation lost after it was
published: the handover's recovery re-announces it, and if the port is full it
is deferred and watched exactly the same way. The caller
may announce it again with `announceVulkanTarget`, after which the owner
constructs it as any other target, or release it. Until it is announced the
owner watches it: while any deferred attachment exists, the owner names its
own next deadline one host idle bound ahead, so it takes rounds without being
woken, and its progress step destroys — on its own thread — the surface of any
deferred attachment whose slot has begun retiring, because it was released or
its window closed. That destruction is what lets the attachment's retirement
finish while the session runs; nothing else would ever tell the owner about
it. An attachment that is still attached may yet be announced, and one whose
announcement was admitted is the owner's ordinary target, so neither is
touched. A destruction there that is uncertain is never attempted again: its
obligation keeps retaining the attachment and the instance, and the step raises
`UnannouncedSurfaceUncertain`, which ends the owner's run and reaches the
application's checkpoints like any other owner failure.

The owner's construction takes the deposit:

- **A live surface** is offered to the roots. The first one is the bootstrap:
  every physical device is queried with each queue family's presentation
  support for that surface, `selectDevice` takes the first satisfying the
  profile — Vulkan 1.3, `dynamicRendering`, `synchronization2`,
  `VK_KHR_swapchain`, `VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1` and its
  `swapchainMaintenance1` feature, and one queue family answering both
  graphics and presentation — and the device is created with that family's one
  queue and `VK_KHR_portability_subset` exactly where the device advertises
  it. No satisfying device is `NoCompatibleDevice`, naming every candidate
  and everything each lacks: a structured startup failure, fatal to the owner,
  whose drain destroys the surface, the messenger and the instance.
- **A later surface** is checked against the session's queue family with
  `vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR`. One it cannot present to is rejected
  with `TargetSurfaceUnsupported`: its surface is destroyed there and then, on
  the owner's thread, the target settles as a verified rollback, and the
  device, the instance and every existing target are untouched. No second
  device and no second queue is ever created (D-7).
- **An unusable surface** — created but unpublished — is destroyed the same way
  and rolled back; **a creation that failed** is rolled back with nothing to
  destroy; **a deposit that never arrived**, because a cancellation lost the
  step's answer, is found on the lease instead and destroyed.

A rejected target's reason is readable with `readTargetRejection` (the most
recent 64 are kept), and its standing with `readTargetStanding` is
`TargetUnusable False`: nothing remains, and the main thread releases it. A
construction whose surface destruction was uncertain settles as partial
instead, and the owner retires it — which is where the uncertainty is kept.
An admitted target is `TargetUsable`; `readVulkanTargets` lists each by its
attachment, with its model identity, designation and surface.

## Destruction order

| Exit | What is destroyed, in order, on the owner's thread |
| --- | --- |
| A window closed or a target released | That target's surface. The owner writes its terminal record only after the destruction returned, and the main thread then certifies the attachment's facts and releases the window. The device, the instance, the owner and every other target stay live, and nothing is joined. |
| Whole-host exit (D-33) | Every remaining target's surface; then — whole-owner retirement — every surface the lease still owes that no target held (an attachment whose announcement never reached the owner), and the device; then — whole-owner destruction — any surface a creation still in its native call left, the explicit messenger, and the instance, the last call that can reach the capture's callback. Only after that evidence is the owner joined, and only then are windows, the session and the capability released. |

Each step is refused rather than reordered when something that must go first
has not verifiably gone. A destruction that raised is uncertain: it is recorded,
never attempted again, and it retains every parent above it. Running a
destruction and recording what it did are one masked step, so a destruction
that returned always removes its record and one that raised — synchronously or
with a cancellation of its own — always leaves it marked uncertain; a
cancellation is re-raised only after that record exists. The failures are
`SurfaceDestructionFailed`, `RootDestructionFailed` and `RootsRetained`, which
name what was retained. The owner then produces no evidence for what is retained, so the host
keeps the window, the session and every parent, as VK-18's contract requires;
only independent evidence ends that wait. The instance is destroyed only once
the surface bridge's lease is releasable. No timeout, cancellation or cleanup
failure is permission (D-33, LIFE D-4).

## Device loss

A native call the layer classifies as device loss — `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`,
and nothing else — latches the loss, closes the roots' admission and fails the
model's session with `DeviceLost`, all in one transaction, and raises
`GraphicsDeviceLost` in the call's place. Raised from the owner's construction
it is the owner's first latched failure, which closes the owner's admission at
once and reaches the application's checkpoints through `superviseGraphicsOwner`
while retirement is still running; a later progress step raises it too. The
retirement that follows is the ordinary child-before-parent one — nothing has
been submitted, and Vulkan permits destroying a lost device's objects without
waiting for work — and nothing is recreated or replayed. A cleanup failure
during it stays behind the loss. An outcome that is unknown rather than lost is
not loss: it is an ordinary failure, and a destruction whose outcome is unknown
retains its parents.

## State

| State | Owner | Readers and writers | Thread | Lifetime | Reset or disposal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Each root's slot (instance, messenger, device) | The roots | Written by startup, admission and retirement; any thread reads | The owner | The session | Only advances: absent, live, then destroyed or uncertain |
| Target records | The roots | Admission inserts, retirement removes | The owner | Admission until destroyed | Removed only by a destruction that returned |
| The GPU model | The roots | Admission, retirement, loss | The owner | The session | Never reset |
| The loss latch | The roots | Set once; any thread reads | Any | The session | Never cleared |
| The requested extensions | The controller | Written once by the session's entry | Main | The host | — |
| The lease | The controller | Written by startup; read by handovers | Owner, main | Startup until destruction | Released before the instance is destroyed |
| Deposits | The controller | Written by a construction step; taken by the owner's construction or retirement | Main, owner | Attachment until its construction or retirement | Cleared by whole-owner retirement |
| Attachment to target | The controller | The owner alone | The owner | Admission until the target's surface is destroyed | Kept on an uncertain destruction |
| Rejections | The controller | Written by the owner; any thread reads | Owner | The most recent 64 | Oldest dropped |
| Deferred attachments | The controller | Written by a handover whose announcement the port refused; removed by `announceVulkanTarget` once admitted, or by the owner once it has destroyed the surface | Main, owner | Until announced or settled | Cleared by whole-owner retirement |

## Evidence

**Headless.** `run-proof.sh --headless` runs, beside the harness's own pure
examples:

- `hetoimasia-gpu-vulkan-native:native-tests` — the profile's decisions, and the
  roots over a stand-in native layer: rollback of exactly what exists at every
  failing creation step, the structured no-device failure, a cancellation at a
  creation's handoff, targets keyed by model identity with their designations,
  the incompatible-target rejection with no second device, the bootstrap
  target owning nothing, the full destruction order, every refused step behind
  an uncertain destruction without a retry — including a destruction that
  raised outright and one a cancellation ended part-way — and device loss closing admission
  with the model failed while an unknown outcome is neither loss nor success;
- `hetoimasia-gpu-vulkan-glfw:integration-tests` — whole graphics hosts over the
  GLFW package's scripted seam, driven through the real owner machinery and
  controller with a stand-in native layer and surface bridge, journalling every
  native call with its thread: thread placement, the shared device, readiness,
  incompatible, unusable and failed surfaces, a full owner port — a deferred
  attachment released and its surface destroyed by the owner while the host
  runs, one announced again and admitted, one whose destruction failed
  reported at a checkpoint without a retry, and one whose answer a cancellation
  lost after publication, recovered into the same watch — rollback at every startup and
  bootstrap step, a cancellation during the handoff's surface creation,
  repeated cancellation during the exit, a first window's close, an individual
  release, the exit order with the owner joined before any window goes, a
  destruction still pending certifying nothing, and device loss reaching a
  checkpoint while retirement is pending, staying primary over a failed
  cleanup that is retained without a retry.

**Native.** The proof harness's VK-7 session runs `withVulkanOwnerHost` itself
over two hidden windows, closes the first-created one while the second stays
attached, and exits, recording every native call's OS thread and the reports
the capture received during it. Its record — under "VK-7: the Vulkan roots
under the graphics owner" — is retained for Linux as
[`docs/vulkan/linux-vk7.md`](vulkan/linux-vk7.md). See
[the proof README](../tools/vulkan-proof/README.md#vk-7-the-vulkan-roots-under-the-graphics-owner).
VK-8 moves these cases into a package-native fixture.
