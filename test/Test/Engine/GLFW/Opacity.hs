-- | Examples proving that the GLFW package keeps its native handles and its
-- session representation out of reach of a client outside the package.
--
-- These examples compile separate single-module clients with the harness from
-- "Test.Engine.Resources.Opacity", exposing @base@, @text@,
-- @hetoimasia-foundation@, and @hetoimasia-glfw@ and hiding everything else.
-- Two clients must be rejected, each for the diagnostic naming its cause: one
-- names the session's data constructor, and one reaches for the native window
-- handle and the production native table, which live in the package's private
-- sublibraries. One client must be accepted, linked, and run: it uses only the
-- public session interface, and every path it takes is refused before GLFW is
-- initialized, so the example opens no display.
